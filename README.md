This code uses Monte Carlo tree search to evaluate the chance of winning of the game of 'Spin the marker?'
The game rules are as follow:
A: There is a circle divided into 10 areas with numbers 1 to 10 written on it.
B: A marker is to spin and stop on one area.
C: The probability of the marker stops on each area is specified as: {1:0.0142, 2:0.3, 3:0.3, 4:0.3, 5:0.0142, 6:0.0142, 7:0.0142, 8:0.0142, 9:0.0142, 10:0.0142}.
D: There will be three rounds of spinning.
E: A fourth spin round will carry out with equal probabilities.
F: The sum of the four numbers which the marker has stopped on should be more than 15 to win the game.
