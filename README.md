This code uses a naive methode and Monte Carlo tree search to evaluate the chance of winning the game of 'Dice'
The game rules are as follows:
A: There are three rounds of throwing dices.
B: Each round has a specific dice with different probabilities of the numbers to show.
E: A fourth round is done with a complete dice (with equal probabilities).
F: The sum of the four numbers which are shown should be more than 16 to win the game.
